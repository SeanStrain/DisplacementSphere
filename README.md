# DisplacementSphere
The two DisplacementSphere C++ files provided in this repository extend [PBRT-v3's](https://github.com/mmp/pbrt-v3) functionality to include displacement mapped spheres. This was completed in my fourth year Computer Graphics university course. The api.cpp file must overwrite that of PBRT-v3's to allow for the new shape.

A full report containing code documentation and a discussion into the mathematics involved is included in this repository also.
